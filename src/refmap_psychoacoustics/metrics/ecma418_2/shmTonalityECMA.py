shmTonalityECMA.py
----------------------

Returns tonality values and frequencies according to ECMA-418-2:2025
(using the Sottek Hearing Model) for an input calibrated single mono
or single stereo audio (sound pressure) time-series signal, p.

Requirements

scipy

Functions
---------

shmTonalityECMA : This is the main tonality function, which implements sections
                  5 and 6 of ECMA-418-2:2025, and returns a dict containing
                  the tonality results as numpy arrays. This function is also
                  called by shmLoudnessECMA() to obtain Sottek Hearing Model
                  psychoacoustic loudness.

shmCritBandAutoCorrelation : A subfunction called by shmTonalityECMA(), which
                             returns the unbiased, normalised estimate of the
                             autocorrelation function for a critical band.
                             
shmCritBandTonalityComponents : A subfunction called by shmTonalityECMA(),
                                which returns the tonal loudness and noise
                                loudess components in each critical band, as
                                well as the band tonality frequencies.

    sampleRateIn : integer

    axisN : integer (0 or 1, default: 0)
            the time axis along which to calculate the tonality

    soundField : keyword string (default: 'freeFrontal')
                 determines whether the 'freeFrontal' or 'diffuse' field stages
                 are applied in the outer-middle ear filter, or 'noOuter' uses
                 only the middle ear stage, or 'noEar' omits ear filtering.
                 Note: these last two options are beyond the scope of the
                 standard, but may be useful if recordings made using
                 artificial outer/middle ear are to be processed using the
                 specific recorded responses.

    waitBar : keyword string (default: True)
              determines whether a progress bar displays during processing

              flag indicating whether to generate a figure from the output
